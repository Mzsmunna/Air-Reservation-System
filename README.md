# Air-Reservation-System
I developed this app while learning C# for the 1st time back in 2017. OOP concept was used while building the project. I build this app using Windows Forms. Also used Microsoft SQL Server as well as LINQ Class to create Object relation Mapping with the Dtabase. Is has Admin Panel and User Panel as well.
