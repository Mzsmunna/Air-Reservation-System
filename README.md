# Air-Reservation-System
I developed this app while learning C# for the 1st time back in 2017. OOP concept was used while building the project. I build this app using Windows Forms. Also used Microsoft SQL Server as well as LINQ Class to create Object relation Mapping with the Dtabase. Is has Admin Panel and User Panel as well.

You need Visual Studio 2013 or Higher along with 4.5 or higher vesion of .NET Framework to run this Software. I have also provided a exe file of the software.

To execute it either extract the Air_Reservation_System.zip file directly on C drive or create a folder 'Air_Reservation_System' in C Drive and put 'Airline_Reservation_System.mdf' & 'Air_Reservation_System_log.ldf' in that directory and then run the Air_Reservation_System.exe file.

There's few bugs. 1st of all not all the exceptions are handled properly and back then in 2017 I couldn't auto increment the table ID in Microsoft SQL Server. SO you have to manually put id for every entry and duplicate entry of same id might cause a runtime error!
